Problem Statement
Currently coding with python if not used with Pythonic idiom would casue the following.
- a lower quality of program, by not using pythonic idiom more resource may be allocated than usual
- Codes will have flaws, without using pythonic idiom some important parts of the codes maybe forgotten and makes the software incomplete
- Code reviews take longer and more tedious, code reviwers that are used to pythonic idiom would take more time to review the codes.
By having a software that handles pytonic idioms, codes used within a program would be using the same format and give other developers the same understanding of the code written.
